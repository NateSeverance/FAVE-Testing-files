AlexS	AlexS	33.50435749995245	34.38422641332955	I'll be a senior
AlexS	AlexS	35.109732359447506	35.8417761853522	this year coming
AlexS	AlexS	38.033730320431985	38.48910107384645	Proctor
AlexS	AlexS	43.55418490895312	45.14412347172226	my mom was born here
AlexS	AlexS	45.290768290618445	46.59513536395817	and my dad was born in
AlexS	AlexS	46.88070685338758	48.5632631965122	New York city but he moved up here
AlexS	AlexS	52.86743855709978	53.500326722862255	no idea
AlexS	AlexS	73.62498503596277	75.04512433474687	yeah sometimes go to the mall there
AlexS	AlexS	80.06357982539285	81.25217467328825	I don't know if I have ever been there
AlexS	AlexS	82.70015701870463	83.44109926154852	I don't think so
AlexS	AlexS	88.84380311561848	91.20555651468337	no but my father went there a couple weeks ago
AlexS	AlexS	92.45551500013528	94.80183210247424	for a guitar club or something like that to see a concert
AlexS	AlexS	98.69177887740463	99.88037372530002	I think so I didn't go with
AlexS	AlexS	103.7635603612003	105.98638708973195	I want to go there again 'cause they got a nice skate park there
AlexS	AlexS	109.86089756793642	111.18841908636504	four years I think
AlexS	AlexS	114.04413398065918	116.31326959936857	it's nice 'cause it's free we used to have to wear helmets but
AlexS	AlexS	117.4551743194939	118.70551435429296	didn't do that until they
AlexS	AlexS	118.82900472810027	119.69343734475147	gave up on it
AlexS	AlexS	123.44445744914864	126.37735382707235	couple summers ago like the year before or two years ago
AlexS	AlexS	129.3662553990277	130.90988507161916	about that long they started
AlexS	AlexS	131.23404730286336	133.84278144954288	with the helmets right away like you can see that sign over there
AlexS	AlexS	136.7602415307407	137.53205636703643	we don't
AlexS	AlexS	145.39040745007927	146.06960450601952	some people
AlexS	AlexS	146.08504080274543	148.89444680686185	falling and running into each other there's not supposed to be bikes in there either
AlexS	AlexS	149.51189867589844	152.8924476588737	that's a big reason that some people get hurt is 'cause they'll smack into each other
AlexS	AlexS	153.92731738752823	155.6521875	or little kinds that don't know what they're doing
AlexS	AlexS	155.94947225862302	156.7675959850965	fall get hurt
AlexS	AlexS	166.1679187465543	169.3477958720927	I don't know if there's a accident but people fought out here I didn't see it but
AlexS	AlexS	169.70283069678874	173.00619819613442	I heard once a kid fell off that quarter pipe and like broke his forearm
AlexS	AlexS	175.46056937555483	177.2618965992886	I wasn't even there but they took him away
AlexS	AlexS	177.3545143796441	180.1639203837605	brought him to the hospital or something like that there's blood all over the ground
AlexS	AlexS	184.0890780077485	187.96358848595304	they probably didn't it probably just wore off by itself through rain and people rolling on it
AlexS	AlexS	193.18067448117222	194.2149063618085	think that was last year
AlexS	AlexS	194.8786671210228	195.55786417696305	last summer
AlexS	AlexS	203.38202632468534	204.43169450204752	never been there either
AlexS	AlexS	208.51692309220357	211.3108927995941	I went there a couple times when I was really little because
AlexS	AlexS	211.34176539304593	213.27130248378523	my grandfather was there but he died and then
AlexS	AlexS	214.19193126678	216.03656872552676	I haven't been there since so I don't really remember it
AlexS	AlexS	221.43991148816244	221.98018187356945	no the
AlexS	AlexS	222.4046800335321	224.41139860790096	farthest place I been to was Virginia beach
AlexS	AlexS	225.07234391588787	227.940590754127	I went there for a R O T C trip 'cause we have it at the highschool
AlexS	AlexS	230.71613747232365	231.73165189342993	we stayed there for a week
AlexS	AlexS	232.03398061421728	232.77817438846313	it's a navy
AlexS	AlexS	233.94770749658275	235.84695202460594	R O T C unit so we stayed there and
AlexS	AlexS	236.70185566879374	239.05846928723886	went on aircraft carriers and submarines and stuff
AlexS	AlexS	242.57769946864443	244.56221619996663	they were great I'm probably going to join the navy
AlexS	AlexS	244.74051262504636	245.65525080589018	when I get out of school
AlexS	AlexS	254.54644323231827	255.67048591216874	none of those places no
AlexS	AlexS	257.8177950316072	258.1511318263215	nope
AlexS	AlexS	267.38257829965465	268.72367749699345	I have no idea it was a bunch a
AlexS	AlexS	269.06476631018944	269.59190356694694	kids
AlexS	AlexS	269.7240126899062	271.7938016245274	that were just like running their mouths and saying stuff
AlexS	AlexS	272.2046586040589	273.28994119150076	to some of my friends
AlexS	AlexS	273.8671183082217	277.73537553060356	and I was gonna help but I was like all the way on the other side and by the time I got out here it was over
AlexS	AlexS	278.51410406730207	279.0257372870961	dark out
AlexS	AlexS	280.07225978212927	281.2195585174249	hitting each other and it was done
AlexS	AlexS	284.41506072502585	285.37631101676004	yeah a few times
AlexS	AlexS	285.8956962550358	286.92671471310547	not in a long time though
AlexS	AlexS	288.662145523907	290.89472684664446	like sixth grade something like that it's been a while
AlexS	AlexS	294.36713535972285	295.5645604389873	I don't even remember
AlexS	AlexS	296.417336035795	297.2094787805392	so long ago
AlexS	AlexS	302.22016306769314	303.1965250554011	I don't know about that
AlexS	AlexS	303.67549508710687	305.37031212237355	probably not I don't have many fights
AlexS	AlexS	314.3497997824665	317.38020632922047	some of 'em are some of 'em are stricter but in a good way to make you
AlexS	AlexS	317.49073787499873	318.7802725757451	actually learn something
AlexS	AlexS	328.2191902119595	330.9548459699714	well if this counts as a subject it's probably the R O T C
AlexS	AlexS	332.2963623333087	335.3728236908036	yeah I took it as an alternative to gym but then I liked it after
AlexS	AlexS	335.41887850154455	336.50577203503076	I started getting more involved
AlexS	AlexS	345.2062082606343	345.87860849745203	a lot of this
AlexS	AlexS	346.072038702564	346.7812827879745	skateboarding and
AlexS	AlexS	347.2141980089394	348.17213807235095	biking and stuff
AlexS	AlexS	349.4507796647961	351.83641886117687	rollerblading all that sorts of stuff and then there's
AlexS	AlexS	352.7265991398002	355.62805221647955	all the people playing basketball the courts are always filled during the summer
AlexS	AlexS	357.40576791107986	358.49266144456607	I don't play myself though
AlexS	AlexS	368.0675796550878	370.1492571005784	well people could go professional doing this
AlexS	AlexS	371.26378352050915	373.455992511778	lots of people make money at it they get sponsored by
AlexS	AlexS	373.47441443607437	375.2521301306747	like shoe brands or skateboard brands
AlexS	AlexS	376.0598927546952	376.7138710672166	they can make money
AlexS	AlexS	379.5199311191474	380.70814523626365	yeah there's some of those
AlexS	AlexS	381.9516251262691	382.70692402242054	tour of
AlexS	AlexS	383.3668302473391	385.3379761470514	games to skate which is like horse but with
AlexS	AlexS	385.59588308720066	387.83414688921044	different letters and they play with the skateboards and
AlexS	AlexS	388.37759365595355	389.7500270160336	could win some money doing that
AlexS	AlexS	396.6922929053581	398.8292361237378	yeah one of my friends does but he's not here right now
AlexS	AlexS	417.31973139527486	418.4250468530575	a bed and a cot
AlexS	AlexS	418.8303291875778	419.78826925098934	a cot is like
AlexS	AlexS	419.939410467421	421.33947671394566	a simpler bed set up
AlexS	AlexS	421.83959123999153	422.44751474177195	not as
AlexS	AlexS	422.935695735626	423.4699315402209	thick with
AlexS	AlexS	424.1796580444254	425.33102831294894	I'm not sure but it's just
AlexS	AlexS	426.3073903006569	427.21006459117933	the same thing it's
AlexS	AlexS	427.33901806125397	428.10352791955364	like lighter
AlexS	AlexS	428.78513911851957	429.9272984248949	carryable something like that
AlexS	AlexS	437.5576639052897	438.85640956818423	getting caught would be like
AlexS	AlexS	439.7964108331251	441.4728059440954	while you're in the act of doing it
AlexS	AlexS	442.2557377266914	442.7070748719526	found out
AlexS	AlexS	442.9649818121019	443.8952889890689	might be after
AlexS	AlexS	453.00429378058567	454.87411909666787	but I think that a bet would be more
AlexS	AlexS	455.73338449964314	457.41899057276163	I dunno a bet sounds worse
AlexS	AlexS	458.7453691221007	459.82305169343874	be something you do at
AlexS	AlexS	460.2099121036627	462.82582535374814	like a casino or something and a wager might be like
AlexS	AlexS	463.1610468077002	464.02367240577894	a friendly bet
AlexS	AlexS	470.64516122994564	471.527171672925	rugs are
AlexS	AlexS	471.7791746566335	472.44795180570577	bigger and
AlexS	AlexS	472.69995478941416	474.8032104611343	thicker and mats are usually smaller
AlexS	AlexS	475.82091481841826	477.0712373145099	yoga or something like that
AlexS	AlexS	507.628790607798	510.3717461612395	the school I go to we have a very strict dress code
AlexS	AlexS	510.41051585104077	512.6494654370655	you have to wear button down shirts with a collar
AlexS	AlexS	512.8312578206654	515.1962088985443	boys and girls no matter what sex
AlexS	AlexS	515.3997497700011	517.5223902866219	I hate those shirts they looks like sacks
AlexS	AlexS	517.8616250723833	519.6450308032428	you can't even tie them at the bottom
AlexS	AlexS	519.8611379646476	523.6024130304725	my girlfriend Jan got detention for that she had to stay 'til six
AlexS	AlexS	523.8641084366312	525.1338157776236	and you gotta wear socks
AlexS	AlexS	525.3664339164313	526.4229079635165	no flipflops
AlexS	AlexS	526.7086982388429	529.6648870861915	the hall monitor stalks you to see if you're out of uniform
AlexS	AlexS	530.2076627434096	533.6775499806254	last week John got suspended because he had said the dresscode sucks
AlexS	AlexS	533.9905803059863	535.8999875287	I don't see what's wrong with that even my
AlexS	AlexS	536.3749162287659	537.2860039390962	father says that
AlexS	AlexS	537.8287795963143	538.5654037025389	you know what I mean
AlexS	AlexS	538.6720203494925	539.9804973802861	I'm so sick of that school

AlexS	AlexS	582.1409162897609	584.0406310900242	somewhat but they are spelled different
AlexS	AlexS	586.0943696771185	587.7130042263225	nearer and mirror
AlexS	AlexS	588.9245570326129	590.5044218920157	yeah they're very similar I would say
AlexS	AlexS	592.1812109759215	593.3152244026095	fool and full
AlexS	AlexS	595.9680566713387	599.4185590636538	somewhat I could see somebody saying that if they slurred it a little bit but
AlexS	AlexS	600.3296467739841	601.134117837361	they're pretty different
