SusanS	SusanS	563.8408672914776	564.798905611625	I would say too
SusanS	SusanS	565.2400167806136	567.1009545247847	you can't even tie them at the bottom
SusanS	SusanS	568.7714740280383	569.7984359683401	my girlfriend

SusanS	SusanS	596.5447862638508	597.6820259963998	that would probably be pretty
SusanS	SusanS	598.4884323522073	599.115637295613	pretty tough
SusanS	SusanS	599.8331192601496	600.6257408919262	to have to wear
