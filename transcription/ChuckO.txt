Chris	Chris	245.89663591272344	246.90941240278346	just from what he told me
Chris	Chris	270.40889906784736	272.0254461577508	quite often I got family out there

Chris	Chris	295.8999524699271	296.8088544481861	usually day trips
Chris	Chris	298.672103503617	300.0744094129309	my sister lives in Buffalo so
Chris	Chris	301.0476251952289	303.60553504832916	I try and get out there as much as possible because my nephew's out there and
Chris	Chris	305.3194644930461	306.33873314009367	Dana she's
Chris	Chris	307.7422876305516	309.84574649452236	twenty six my nephew's four and he's just

Chris	Chris	327.07998927476825	328.56669322492047	Albany been to a few times
Chris	Chris	328.85760724682206	330.68839551731514	as a kid going with the family going to the
Chris	Chris	331.63841966936377	332.7096255723119	museum out there
Chris	Chris	334.1768530515014	334.96889620398423	I do have a 
Chris	Chris	336.91284515876725	338.81504715612357	small amount of family that is out there
Chris	Chris	339.66614450513157	341.21127786817186	but really not much time out there
Chris	Chris	343.43407767466664	345.38172477093593	I think I've traveled through Binghamton once
Chris	Chris	345.5310443816499	347.1605757855285	I was on my way down to spring break
Chris	Chris	349.64337377027937	351.59751302353624	we went to North Carolina
Chris	Chris	352.6028771989535	353.3689517234861	it was a good time
Chris	Chris	359.1760449984931	360.4095548261303	about two or three times a year
Chris	Chris	361.30547249041416	362.57793525997675	maybe a Yankee game
Chris	Chris	363.3764705694471	364.38924705950717	some I go down there
Chris	Chris	365.49539586414096	366.80681157562896	one of my buddies is
Chris	Chris	367.1898488378952	368.280531211806	he lives down there we'll go down there
Chris	Chris	368.42985082252	369.76074300497066	maybe spend a weekend with him
Chris	Chris	374.46788573750854	374.96778182555096	vacation
Chris	Chris	382.2711625694776	383.69943710674175	Cleveland well Cedar Point
Chris	Chris	384.02404495611995	384.69922928282665	just to go to
Chris	Chris	385.62699996621166	386.8410333228862	the amusement park out there
Chris	Chris	388.49653335471504	389.39894317598646	just a weekend thing
Chris	Chris	394.66472380127345	395.4632591107439	Connecticut a lot
Chris	Chris	397.2226336543738	398.3133160282846	family out there too
Chris	Chris	398.7612748604265	399.1832650646182	so
Chris	Chris	399.8006442690087	400.61216389245425	I'd say
Chris	Chris	402.7551994958574	403.24860342691227	it's probably
Chris	Chris	403.8134210848304	405.6247328843608	three or four times a year we go out to Connecticut
Chris	Chris	413.24871094436077	413.87195801516697	a lot of people
Chris	Chris	414.4562521440477	415.65080902975956	go to the Adirondacks
Chris	Chris	418.11536358608646	419.34238125673613	just a chance to get away from this
Chris	Chris	419.9421418163399	421.9092653835719	what I like to call the armpit of New York
Chris	Chris	423.4191604709083	424.6916232404709	it's just a chance to get away from
Chris	Chris	428.35104658126306	429.2924093444599	not that it's a big city
Chris	Chris	432.0330367686678	435.2596387914872	I think people deal with a lot of stress as far as the economics of the area
Chris	Chris	435.56230507095523	437.5099521672245	and to get away to the Adirondacks is just a
Chris	Chris	437.6787482489012	438.99016396038917	a way to let go for a while
Chris	Chris	444.4108191779222	445.7287270463977	we got a hunting camp up there
Chris	Chris	446.5442737278833	448.1348521898366	fishing up on the lakes and everything
Chris	Chris	457.94050788254174	458.323545144808	bear
Chris	Chris	458.57024711033546	459.0506667274152	deer
Chris	Chris	459.6933902691841	460.61527656141817	some waterfowl
Chris	Chris	461.34889030101294	463.1342334725931	turkey we usually do around this area
Chris	Chris	467.1547525057414	467.90784271629883	well I didn't get
Chris	Chris	468.93731818655573	471.35153125	kind of a good story didn't actually bag it
Chris	Chris	473.21318404934794	474.38826446409706	it was an odd meeting
Chris	Chris	475.3231350703063	476.3294194033788	it was a morning hunt
Chris	Chris	478.4517454932803	481.3667239806967	we set up four hunters a hundred and fifty yards apart
Chris	Chris	481.70988765031734	483.2550210133576	and then about a mile and a half away
Chris	Chris	483.9339200062859	487.05015536031675	we have about six or seven hunters and they pushed their way all the way down to us
Chris	Chris	487.5914865070324	489.0262532012841	sorta push animals that way
Chris	Chris	490.4090826396353	492.48008071866826	some people may not agree with it but they usually
Chris	Chris	494.21411141798495	495.9475173336646	it's a guaranteed way to get an animal
Chris	Chris	496.6595018951679	499.39919214392006	and that morning they had kicked a bear out of its den
Chris	Chris	500.30748586327724	502.5992172798874	and I didn't even realize it was coming until it was about
Chris	Chris	502.76523587079816	506.77738888911284	thirty yards away from me and I turn around and there's a huge black bear just looking at me and
Chris	Chris	507.57531643274655	508.80882626038374	I screamed at it and
Chris	Chris	509.2438007785505	511.0291439501307	it went this way I went the other way and
Chris	Chris	512.7520466824529	513.7907918004632	my best encounter but
Chris	Chris	514.3314981635417	516.1038570211467	last year I did have a couple deer I got
Chris	Chris	520.975767791191	523.2285462658757	there's another one of us who had an encounter with a bear and
Chris	Chris	525.2924444220845	526.8116091571745	he had to change his underpants in the woods
Chris	Chris	527.138385745352	527.9563975257851	his encounter
