BrianL	BrianL	98.5945554910396	99.65886610802633	I'll probably look somewhere else
BrianL	BrianL	100.72317672501306	101.24783688831639	initially
BrianL	BrianL	106.77300574534897	107.29766590865228	yes
BrianL	BrianL	113.18885002802953	115.37743242352337	there's not a lot of white collar professional jobs
BrianL	BrianL	116.50899002888437	118.38277632639621	I guess it it depends on what you're looking for like
BrianL	BrianL	120.21159175276777	121.20095091785403	if you were I guess
BrianL	BrianL	121.35085382165498	123.41951389410805	there's no accountants looking for work around here
BrianL	BrianL	124.4238633495744	127.36196026407298	or real estate people but maybe if you were like a
BrianL	BrianL	127.95435214247385	130.23287628024826	I don't know like a like an engineer of some kind
BrianL	BrianL	130.51769179747006	131.73190531825773	there's not much for that
BrianL	BrianL	133.03606058132598	134.56507020009565	a lot of that industry has moved away
BrianL	BrianL	139.06749992212798	140.07184937759433	I have no idea right now
BrianL	BrianL	140.77639302545876	141.5109172540834	I tell people
BrianL	BrianL	142.395344386509	145.93305291621135	I'm gonna be the C E O of Exxon Mobile when they ask me what I want to be when I grow up
BrianL	BrianL	157.67406250000002	159.841677548216	not so much in downtown there's uh some bars
BrianL	BrianL	160.39631829227952	162.24012400903118	a half mile away or a mile away from downtown
BrianL	BrianL	162.83973562423495	165.2531723754302	that has gotten pretty big in the past couple years
BrianL	BrianL	165.38808498885106	166.9920460595212	they have a big even on Thursday night
BrianL	BrianL	167.9137382728049	169.48771876271485	and that's the only night people really go out

BrianL	BrianL	188.13473397864527	189.66374359741494	I don't know anything specific
BrianL	BrianL	191.4625784430263	192.46692789849266	Syracuse is bigger
BrianL	BrianL	197.9983450487476	199.45240321561678	they have a major university there
BrianL	BrianL	200.32184005766229	201.37116038426893	bigger major university
BrianL	BrianL	203.22468020513685	204.40891314516432	I don't know what else to say
BrianL	BrianL	208.39633038626954	209.53559245515675	probably Yankees most
BrianL	BrianL	210.92968946050556	211.76914572179086	but the Mets
BrianL	BrianL	214.14343860488398	217.35136074622426	Giants Jets and Bill Syracuse basketball and
BrianL	BrianL	218.01093352294842	218.94033152651429	football
BrianL	BrianL	222.21381741274735	223.03088208616785	what am I missing
BrianL	BrianL	223.9983731045016	224.65794588122577	basketball
BrianL	BrianL	225.24256720604947	225.76722736935278	basketball
BrianL	BrianL	227.1313437939414	229.54478054513666	there's no particular allegiance around here for basketball
BrianL	BrianL	239.12940475950037	239.81895811698473	in school
BrianL	BrianL	240.59845321674965	241.9325890605781	or like in my school age
BrianL	BrianL	242.93693851604442	243.53655013124822	two
BrianL	BrianL	247.75659327669905	250.30494264131514	one kid started messing with me he just wanted to see if I would
BrianL	BrianL	250.71405098262306	251.50853637276808	hit him back
BrianL	BrianL	252.00321595531122	253.1424780241984	and the other kid
BrianL	BrianL	253.62216731636144	257.0999146845434	was one of my good friends he said that he thought he could beat me up so
BrianL	BrianL	257.3697399113851	258.83878836863437	I said no you can't and then
BrianL	BrianL	262.7101687293319	264.16422689620106	I won that one against my friend
BrianL	BrianL	278.25881341628667	278.9783473545312	highschool
BrianL	BrianL	281.88646368826954	285.39419163721163	these two girls were going I've seen two crazy ones one was in highschool
BrianL	BrianL	285.4159810375886	287.6495343042227	these two girl were going at it one she got her shirt rippe off
BrianL	BrianL	289.5832817632549	291.3221554473459	no security saw it for like
BrianL	BrianL	291.5170292222871	292.6263107104141	they went on for like a good
BrianL	BrianL	293.1809514544776	294.35019410412497	one two minutes
BrianL	BrianL	294.5494383801116	295.9435353854604	and another one two
BrianL	BrianL	295.9435353854604	297.4425644234699	a boy and a girl were going at it and they were like
BrianL	BrianL	297.4725450042301	300.3920625	spinning and it went all the way up a hallway all the way up a set of stairs
BrianL	BrianL	300.6055156936698	304.08326306185177	while everybody was in there waiting to get out of the lunchroom so those two
BrianL	BrianL	325.5862026768215	327.7448044915551	is the cot is the cot the thing that hangs
BrianL	BrianL	328.0745908799172	330.53299850225267	you tie like one end to the tree the another end to the tree is that it
BrianL	BrianL	330.907755761755	332.04701783064223	hammock alright
BrianL	BrianL	334.20561964537586	335.06006619704124	a cot
BrianL	BrianL	336.07024398230186	337.4193701165104	I think a cot is smaller
BrianL	BrianL	339.65292338314447	340.22255441758807	generally not
BrianL	BrianL	341.3618164864752	342.5010785553624	cot is more mobile
BrianL	BrianL	342.7259329110638	343.4454668493084	bed is not
BrianL	BrianL	344.0750590452723	345.13936966225907	generally mobile
BrianL	BrianL	346.09055673451286	347.81444012822374	big and heavy clunky
BrianL	BrianL	361.38939458767817	362.5586372373255	I don't really use found out
BrianL	BrianL	364.95708369814065	367.5803845146572	I don't really wouldn't really differentiate between either
BrianL	BrianL	383.6050700259627	386.13842910019866	I wouldn't really differentiate between either in my mind
BrianL	BrianL	392.77912773858054	393.963360678608	a rug is probably larger
BrianL	BrianL	395.43969396764436	396.33911139045	covers more of the room
BrianL	BrianL	396.56396574615144	397.598295782378	sometimes it's permanent
BrianL	BrianL	398.42276175328317	399.187266562668	or at least
BrianL	BrianL	399.78687817787176	400.4314606642158	fixed
BrianL	BrianL	400.776237342958	402.26027609058735	fixed to the floor
BrianL	BrianL	402.56008189818925	403.12971293263286	mat
BrianL	BrianL	403.8642371612575	404.73367400330295	smaller
BrianL	BrianL	405.0784506820451	406.39759623549344	usually in front of a door
BrianL	BrianL	415.20563868576687	416.83958033719716	far as I know syracuse yeah
BrianL	BrianL	423.19067233050595	425.259332402959	apparently not I was just told the other night that they don't
BrianL	BrianL	428.25739047897787	429.0968467402632	Sunday night
BrianL	BrianL	429.95129329192855	431.5252737818385	or I don't know the night before I me you
BrianL	BrianL	436.0746175938612	436.74918066096546	girl went to
BrianL	BrianL	437.42374372806967	438.1282873759341	Albany
BrianL	BrianL	439.1026562506403	440.1519765772469	the way I said something
BrianL	BrianL	441.78980333962136	443.6186187659929	pointed out that I have an accent and that
BrianL	BrianL	444.2182303811967	445.5223856442649	I said no I don't have an accent
BrianL	BrianL	445.8821526133872	447.06638555341465	and she
BrianL	BrianL	447.3255913226107	448.5398048433984	she said yes I get
BrianL	BrianL	448.7646591990998	452.67712498830446	I get made fun of all the time by people in Albany because she's originally from Utica
BrianL	BrianL	452.9319599247661	454.2960763493547	for the way she says words
BrianL	BrianL	459.71388522815334	460.7032443932396	definitely yeah
BrianL	BrianL	467.1258877859169	469.49435366597186	I guess they way they they enunciate more
BrianL	BrianL	471.3560633404672	474.1292670607847	I don't want to say it sounds harsher I dunno maybe that's just their style
BrianL	BrianL	474.20421851268515	475.0886456451107	it's not necessarily the
BrianL	BrianL	477.1123348464235	480.3952084396642	words their the style that they're using you know rather than
BrianL	BrianL	505.69069317924294	508.4189260284201	school I go to we have a very strict dress code
BrianL	BrianL	508.64378038412156	510.6824598758144	we'd have to wear button down shirts with a collar
BrianL	BrianL	513.0659160462494	515.3444401840238	boys and girls no matter what sex
BrianL	BrianL	515.6742265723859	517.0983041584949	I hate those shirts
BrianL	BrianL	517.2931779334361	518.537372034984	they look like sacks
BrianL	BrianL	518.9653561093052	520.7492006645364	you can't even tie them at the bottom
BrianL	BrianL	521.2138996663193	523.5673752559942	my girlfriend Jan got detention for that
BrianL	BrianL	523.7622490309354	525.5460935861666	she had to stay 'till six
BrianL	BrianL	526.1906760725108	528.2743264353438	and you got to wear socks no flip flops
BrianL	BrianL	528.4392196295249	530.522869992358	the hall monitor stalks you

BrianL	BrianL	532.5838246062181	536.0765622647801	last week John got suspended because he said the dress code sucks
BrianL	BrianL	536.9310088164455	538.2501543698938	I don't see what's wrong with that
BrianL	BrianL	538.4000572736948	539.8241348598037	even my father says that
BrianL	BrianL	541.0533386709715	541.8178434803563	you know what I mean
